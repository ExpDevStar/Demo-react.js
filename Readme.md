## React.js

These are the files that I prepared for the Advanced Topics section of Fall 2013's first webdev meeting.

The final demo is contained in `index.html`, and the same file at different stages of development was saved with different names so you can track the progress.

- `hello_world.html` is the most basic version and only creates a react.js element on the page
- `basic_list.html` goes through basic iteration for generating multiple react elements on the page
- `reactive_list.html` shows how to add reactivity to these lists by changing their attribute according to events
- `reactive_tabs_box` converts the list to a menu that changes the currently active tab based on clicks
- `index.html` is the final version of the demo that shows how we can change the element's state to create new tabs and to chance the active tab
